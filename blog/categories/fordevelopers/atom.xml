    <id>http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/11/05/how-recruiters-get-compensated</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a recruiter, I&rsquo;m compensated based on the portion my company takes in. My current company handles both contract and direct hire work and I&rsquo;ll explain details for both of these.</p>

<p>For direct hire work, we charge our clients a percentage of a candidates first year salary. These percentages range from 15% up to 25%, with the occasional 30% mixed in. For example, if your first year salary would be $100,000 and we had a 20% agreement with our client, they would pay us $20,000. Most of the time, this $20,000 would be paid between 30-90 days of employment. Of course, if you were to quit, get fired, etc, we would pay back a pro-rated portion of that fee.</p>

<p>Now, of that 20%, most recruiters would see somewhere around 10% of that. So, on a $20,000 fee, a recruiter would see $2,000. An account manager would see a similar amount.</p>

<p>Contract work is a bit different. Most of the time, our client will tell us what they need as far as skills go, and then tell us a bill rate that they&rsquo;ll pay us, per hour. Let&rsquo;s just say that&rsquo;s $100/HR. My job at that point, is to go find someone with that skillset. Let&rsquo;s say I do just that, and that person is asking for $60/HR. Assuming this person works on my company&rsquo;s W2 (and not as an independent consultant), we incur an additional burden, somewhere between 15% and 20%. Add that in and that candidate&rsquo;s total cost to us could be as high as $72/HR. At this point, the difference between the bill rate and the pay rate (what we call, the spread) is $28/HR.</p>

<p>Recruiting companies compensate contract placements differently. Some companies make tiers out of it. For example, a $5 spread earns you 3%, a $7 spread earns you 5%, a $10 spread earns you 7%, so on and so forth. Some companies will compensate you based on how much you&rsquo;ve built up. For example, if you&rsquo;re making $100/HR in spread, a company will pay you 5%, if you&rsquo;re making $200/HR in spread, you&rsquo;ll be compensated at $7%, etc. Another way to compensate it is based on the margin %. If my margin is 30% (Pay Rate * 130% = Bill Rate), then perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a certain percentage. If my margin is 40%, then I&rsquo;ll get a higher percentage. There&rsquo;s just a wide variety of ways of doing things.</p>

<p>Now, admittedly, recruiters have an incentive to lower your contract dollars in order to make more money. It happens. It&rsquo;s a practice. We&rsquo;re not trying to hurt anyone. It&rsquo;s just a practice that&rsquo;s taught and we&rsquo;re just trying to do the best for our company. But personally, I&rsquo;d much rather keep a $10 spread, keep you as a candidate happy, and make a placement, instead of haggling with you for an extra few dollars, leave a bad taste in your mouth, and you look for a new job two months into a contract. That&rsquo;s just me though.</p>

    <link href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/03/26/get-the-right-recruiters-to-find-you/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-26T10:00:58-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/03/26/get-the-right-recruiters-to-find-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in &ldquo;<a href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/24/what-recruiters-do/">What Recruiters Do</a>,&rdquo; there is a wide spread in the quality of recruiters out there. As long as you have a resume somewhere, or information about you online somewhere, recruiters are going to be looking for you.</p>

<p>A recruiter I&rsquo;ve e-mailed with said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes its a numbers game, and we eventually bump into someone actively looking to relocate, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a numbers game, and typically the more people a recruiter can get in touch with, the better the chances are for them that they&rsquo;ll find the person for a position they are trying to fill.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;<a href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/03/12/technical-recruiters-how-to-select-a-good-one/">Technical Recruiters: How to Select a Good One</a>&rdquo; Ari talked about how to pick a good recruiter based on the way they contact you, so here are some things you can do to market yourself so that more good recruiters will find you.</p>

<h2>#1 Have a meaningful LinkedIn intoductory paragraph</h2>

<p>Several recruiters have told me that LinkedIn is where they live (and based on the volume of contacts I get, I believe them!) Possibly the single most important thing you can do to get good recruiters to find you is to have a LinkedIn profile, and have a good introductory paragraph about yourself. The good recruiters use this to find out what you&rsquo;re passionate about, what you&rsquo;re currently doing, and what would be interesting enough to get you to change jobs.</p>

<p>Job Tips For Geeks has a little more to say about using LinkedIn too: &ldquo;<a href="http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/07/30/linked/">LinkedIn Spam (?) and Recruiters: A Guide for Geeks</a>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>#2 Tell Recruiters What You Want</h2>

<p>When recruiters contact you, tell them what you want. Have a canned response that tells them exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for (or what kind of crazy thing you&rsquo;d have to see to even consider moving), and they won&rsquo;t bug you again until they have it for you. Job Tips For Geeks sums this this up nicely</p>

<blockquote><p>If you don’t want recruiters to waste your time contacting you about every job order that comes across their desk, politely let recruiters know what type of job would interest you.</p></blockquote>

<p>(From: &ldquo;<a href="http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/04/12/why-recruiters-suck-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">Why Recruiters Suck, And What You Can Do About It</a>&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Recruiters have massive databases and tools at their disposal, (a recruiter just recently pointed me to a new (to me) one: <a href="https://www.connectifier.com">Connectifier</a>, started by some ex-Googlers), and once they know what you&rsquo;re looking for, your chances of hearing about something great go way up.</p>

<p>There are even things out there as crazy as &ldquo;Do Not Hire&rdquo; lists. The Wall Street Journal talked about this in 2010: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703389004575033583145567138">How a Black Mark Can Derail a Job Search</a>.</p>

<h2>Or don&rsquo;t</h2>

<p>To the celebratory cheers of your co-workers and friends, delete your LinkedIn account due to &lsquo;Recruiter Spam&rsquo;.  You won&rsquo;t get any more InMails, but the bad recruiters are going to find your Github username, your e-mail address, your unlisted phone number, your Grandmother&rsquo;s address, and they aren&rsquo;t going to leave you alone.</p>

    <link href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/03/12/technical-recruiters-how-to-select-a-good-one/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-12T12:24:55-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/03/12/technical-recruiters-how-to-select-a-good-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your phone rings, again, and you regret the day you ever posted your cell phone number on Monster three years ago.  Without even listening to your voicemail, you are able to repeat the message verbatim since you have heard it some many times, from so many different recruiters.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hi Bill, my name is Tom from ABC Technology, and I have a copy of your resume.  I have a great Ruby opportunity for you, so call me back.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>For many, these messages have simply become pure voice spam.  When you couple this with the telemarketing component and the typical general job description &ldquo;email blasts&rdquo;, it complicates it even more. Never mind the fact that you&rsquo;re a C# developer and it doesn&rsquo;t sound like they read your resume anyway.  However, despite some of the annoyances created by the supply and demand of the IT Technical talent today, working with a good technical recruiter does have its advantages.  After all, the technical recruiter probably works for a company that invests a significant amount of money annually to build relationships with the managers that want to hire you.</p>

<p>Choosing a good recruiter requires a similar approach one would take in choosing a doctor, lawyer or tax advisor.  If you determine that including a technical recruiter, or two, in your career search activities could potentially provide value, it is very important that you spend a few minutes to qualify the individuals you will be working with.  After all, most people spend the majority of their life engaged in the workplace and it is important to ensure the person representing you acknowledges this- and can best represent you.  Here are some qualifiers to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Consider the level of sophistication of the recruiter&rsquo;s initial approach.</strong>  So you received a voicemail from a technical recruiter that clearly stood out to you in a positive way.  Maybe they sent you an email that addressed items that were important to you because they took the time to review your blog or contributions on Stack Overflow.  It would stand to reason that if this recruiter was professional enough to take the time to research you and prepare an appropriate and relevant introduction, that there may be value in getting back to them.  While you should still interview the recruiter, you just narrowed down the pool to the most detailed oriented recruiters who clearly &ldquo;get it&rdquo; when trying to reach out appropriately to potential candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Ask your colleagues for a recruiter referral.</strong>  A recruiter recommendation from a colleague is a great place to start. In the recruiting industry, the candidates we receive as a referral for a job well done are our most valuable resource.  With the large number of candidates that technical recruiters work with, extra time and attention is typically given to the referrals we receive from our consultants and former placements.   While there is no guarantee you will get placed, any recruiter worth engaging with will ensure they will do the best they can as a result of how they were introduced.  Even if they don&rsquo;t have the perfect job for you, the recruiter you were referred to will typically want to be there for you for objective counseling throughout your job search process.  Keep in mind that while most technical recruiters will not provide you a great definition of polymorphism, anyone worth working with will know which organizations in your geographic area are looking for the specific talents you possess.</p>

<p><strong>Linkedin Recommendations.</strong>  While there may be exceptions, technical recruiters with multiple LinkedIn recommendations are another good place to start.  I am not referring to the &ldquo;quick click&rdquo; endorsements that have been adopted on LinkedIn recently, but rather the  complete written recommendation where someone has taken the time write their perspective on how the recruiter (and their organization) provided value to them.  If you don&rsquo;t see any recommendations, it does not mean the recruiter is not a good one.  However, if they have been in the industry for a while and know their trade, it would be a flag if there were none.  While the recruiter certainly controls which recommendations will appear on their LinkedIn profile, you can certainly detect the level of sincerity from what is written.  Just like the generic job descriptions you may receive, it will not be difficult to read through the fluff.  Also, if you see recommendations from other software developers and hiring managers that speak to their expertise, you are probably looking at someone who knows their stuff.  One of my favorite types of LinkedIn recommendations comes from those individuals the recruiter never placed at all.  This speaks volumes.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking the ice quickly.</strong> The relationship between the technical recruiter and their software developer really needs to be a trusted partnership. That means that open and honest dialogue is the key to a successful relationship.  Once you break down the barriers, you both can determine very quickly whether an opportunity exists to move forward on a particular job.  It really comes down to breaking the defenses quickly with someone you just met over the phone.   That is why professionalism and credibility is so important.  The recruiter&rsquo;s biggest fear is that you will be given the name of their client (that their company invests many thousands of dollars per year building a relationship with) and approach them on your own, or refer a friend to them directly.  By letting the recruiter you are speaking with know up front that you are a person of integrity and you promise not to approach their client on your own, it will certainly break down one of the major walls.  Getting this out of the way quickly will bring forward a lot of the specific details about the culture, compensation and career path you were looking to evaluate.  On the recruiting side, letting us know what your biggest motivators are in your career change is the only way we can ensure your time is best utilized.  No recruiter wants to send you on interviews for jobs that would not interest you based on information that should have been discussed about your desires from the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Interview the technical recruiter.</strong>  Recruiters tend to ask some very bold questions about your current job and compensation, etc…  It is ok to ask some tough questions yourself.  I have heard some teach their recruiting teams over the years that it is extremely important to have &ldquo;control&rdquo; over their candidates throughout the process.  This methodology sends the wrong message to new recruiters starting out.  In interviewing scores of recruiters over the years, I have noticed that one of the typical signs you are talking to an inexperienced recruiter is that they begin by asking fast and direct questions to qualify you for one job.  Instead of a professional discussion about what you are looking for overall, they jump right to compensation and negotiation, without even knowing what is important to you in your next role.  Some good questions to ask a recruiter are:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How many software engineers have you placed in the last two years?"<br/>
"What were their specific skill sets?&rdquo;  <br/>
&ldquo;How many of them were software engineers with my skill set?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How long have you made IT placements with the client company you called me about?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You said in your message this was a good job for my career, explain why please.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What can you tell me about the Software Engineering market in Atlanta?</p></blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind, it is not just whether a recruiter answers the questions you ask correctly, but how they answer the question.  Do you sense a passion for serving their candidates well?  Can you sense that they go above and beyond the norm when it comes to their knowledge about their client specifics and details?  In other words, do their answers display a depth and breadth of knowledge about the career market in your discipline to be an asset to you?   If so, then you may have found a good technical recruiter to build a relationship with.</p>

    <link href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/24/what-recruiters-do/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-24T11:47:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/24/what-recruiters-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>What does a recruiter do, anyway?</h1>

<p>Recruiters just call you about &lsquo;great opportunities&rsquo; that are actually terrible, right? That may be all you are exposed to, so here is a bit about what recruiters actually do. Not all recruiters are great at what they do, just like not all developers are great at what they do, so this won&rsquo;t all apply to everyone that contacts you.</p>

<p>Wikipedia actually has a pretty thorough page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruiter">Recruiter</a>. Aside from that, the first couple of pages of search results that try to answer this question are covered in ads and seem a bit too spammy for my tastes. From Wikipedia, the breakdown is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Job analysis &ndash; figuring out actual job requirements</li>
<li>Sourcing &ndash; identifying candidates to fill job vacancies</li>
<li>Screening and Selection &ndash; filtering through potential people to find the best fit</li>
<li>Lateral hiring &ndash; &ldquo;sniping&rdquo; people based on their current jobs</li>
</ul>


<p>True North (a recruiting agency) <a href="http://www.truenorth-us.com/blog-and-news/news/162-five-things-a-recruiter-does-everyday">sums this up as</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recruiters must be organized, possess strong people and sales skills, and maintain a strong work ethic to be successful. Here are five tasks that a recruiter juggles daily:</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Sourcing &ndash; identifying candidates to fill job vacancies</li>
<li>Host Interviews &ndash; interviewing potential people to find the best fit</li>
<li>Prepare Applicants for Client Interviews</li>
<li>Scan Resumes &ndash; in-between the rest of things, continually filter resumes for possible matches for all open jobs</li>
<li>Maintain Relationships With Placed Candidates &ndash; Making sure people stay at a job long enough for the recruiter to get paid, and the person may need a recruiters help in the future.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What you see</h2>

<p>Sourcing is the part that most people get to see, and it is the hardest and least-favorite part of most recruiters job&rsquo;s. Similarly to any kind of sales position, successful response rates to &lsquo;cold calls&rsquo; are very low and these are generally not well-received.</p>

<p>Recruiters know that more &lsquo;organic&rsquo; means of finding people is better, so they sponsor events like meet-ups and user groups, and they try to make things a fair trade.  As you grumble about how the recruiter spends 5 minutes talking about the jobs they are trying to fill, enjoy the pizza they bought for you and listen. Maybe they do have a job for you!</p>

<p>There are going to be some rough edges to all this, so enjoy the pizza and know that if you give a recruiter constructive feedback, they will be happy to hear it and are constantly trying to improve.</p>

<h2>What you don&rsquo;t see</h2>

<p>Recruiters much prefer matching up the right person with the right job, and giving you a call with a job offer. Jess Kimmet wrote a good post on this that answers more of &ldquo;What does a Recruiter like doing?&rdquo;:  <a href="http://www.volt.com/Blog/What_Does_a_Recruiter_Do_Anyway.aspx">What Does a Recruiter Do, Anyway?</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I work hard every day to leave a positive impression with everyone I work with. I may not be able to find a position for everyone, but I want them to know that I&rsquo;m on their side – and I&rsquo;d like nothing more than being able to call and say, &ldquo;Congratulations! You got the job.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Recruiters at recruiting agencies work with multiple companies and are almost always looking to fill multiple positions, so once they know about you and know your qualifications and what you&rsquo;re looking for, they will contact you when something pops up that you&rsquo;ll be a good fit for. The more great people a recruiter has &lsquo;on file&rsquo;, the better of a job they can do and the more the get paid. You being &lsquo;on file&rsquo; with more recruiters improves your chances of one of them getting it right.</p>

<h2>Working at an Agency</h2>

<p>Recruiters working at an Agency are typically working to fill jobs for multiple companies, and are paid based on how well they fill these jobs.  Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.prestigestaffing.com/work-at-prestige/">job posting for Prestige Staffing</a>:</p>

<p>A Recruiter’s job duties include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Successfully recruiting and personally interviewing qualified job candidates</li>
<li>Working closely with account managers to plan and prioritize recruiting needs</li>
<li>Successfully matching candidates with clients’ employee requirements</li>
<li>Confidently and successfully negotiating terms of employment</li>
<li>Building and nurturing long-term relationships with candidates and clients</li>
<li>Capably multi-tasking in a fast-paced, demanding professional environment</li>
</ul>


<p>Job Qualifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bachelor’s Degree</li>
<li>Excellent oral communication skills</li>
<li>Positive attitude and strong work ethic</li>
<li>Coachable and enthusiastic about being part of a team</li>
<li>The intellect to “think on your feet,” solve problems, and make wise decisions</li>
<li>A strong desire to pursue a career in sales and management</li>
</ul>


<h2>Working as an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; Recruiter</h2>

<p>Working in-house, recruiters are filling multiple jobs at one company. They are paid a salary and typically aren&rsquo;t paid based on exact numbers of jobs or hiring salaries.</p>

<p>Google is currently hiring a (probably a lot more than one) Recruiter: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=3781001&amp;">Apply Here</a>. Here is what they are looking for:</p>

<p>Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop strong relationships with candidates, understanding their needs and helping them find a fit at Google.</li>
<li>Keep candidates continually informed with quality communications throughout the hiring process.</li>
<li>Solve problems and produce solutions by collecting and analyzing data, identifying alternatives when circumstances change and seeking out additional responsibilities.</li>
<li>Keep partners apprised of and involved in work by communicating information and status to project leads and team members, coordinating work cross-functionally and influencing peers, project leaders and/or managers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Qualifications</p>

<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree or equivalent practical experience.</li>
<li>2 years work experience in recruiting, sales or client service role.</li>
<li>Track record of solving complex problems and delivering significant impact.</li>
<li>Experience closing candidates and negotiating complex compensation packages.</li>
<li>Proven organizational skills with attention to detail and the ability to prioritize and succeed in an environment with competing demands.</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills with an emphasis on tact and diplomacy.</li>
<li>Proven ability to take initiative, use consultative skills and build strong, productive relationships.</li>
<li>Exposure to HR processes, such as interviewing and candidate evaluation.</li>
<li>A track record of demonstrating a strong work ethic, integrity and personal accountability.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/13/recruiters-in-big-companies/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-13T19:44:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/13/recruiters-in-big-companies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been in California this week for <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2014">Strata</a>, and I’ve gotten a chance to talk to a handful of recruiters about things from their perspective. This post is about recruiters that work full-time for big companies, I&rsquo;ll get to those that work for Agencies and small companies in future posts. First up are a few examples of what I think are great &ldquo;<a href="http://recruiterproject.org/blog/2014/02/10/making-first-contact/">First Contact</a>&rdquo; e-mails.</p>

<p>Before Strata, I got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter at Amazon that I&rsquo;d give a 9/10 to.  Nothing particularly targeted to me other than the fact that I&rsquo;m going to a conference, but that counts!</p>

<blockquote><p>Happy New Year from Amazon! I’m writing to let you know that if you’re planning on attending the Strata Conference in Santa Clara, Amazon will be speaking at the event. We’ll also be setting up informational interviews to discuss our exciting career opportunities and it would be great to connect with you at the conference. I’ve included a link to some of our job descriptions to give you an idea of what we’re working on and we’d love to see you there!</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more, please contact me and we can arrange a time to chat one-on-one. Be sure to stop by and say hello at booth 729!</p></blockquote>

<p>The link she included was to a &ldquo;Job Posting&rdquo; entitled: &ldquo;Come Visit Amazon at the Strata Conference&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ll paste here in case they &ldquo;fill&rdquo; that position:</p>

<blockquote><p>Job Description: Our mission is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company and we’re looking for Earth’s most talented Data Scientists, Software Developers, and Technical Program Managers to relentlessly pursue this mission with us.</p>

<p>Basic Qualifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work with massive data sets</li>
<li>Guide the optimization and efficiency of a market-leading program</li>
<li>Directly influence Amazon’s core business strategies</li>
<li>Solve complex technology problems</li>
<li>Work with world-class marketing and technology teams on creative analytical solutions</li>
<li>Significantly impact Amazon systems, businesses, and most importantly, our customers</li>
<li>Stretch your business and technical skills working with developers, data scientists, and business teams to design and implement game-changing features</li>
</ul>


<p>Preferred Qualifications</p>

<p>At Amazon, understanding extremely large sets of customer data is paramount to our success in providing a seamless customer experience across all platforms. Make an impact working with world-class marketing and technology teams on creative analytical solutions, guiding the optimization and efficiency of market-leading programs, and directly influence Amazon’s core business strategies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fun, to the point, and not trying to get me to commit to anything.  I&rsquo;ve gotten similar well-played communications from other big companies like Google:</p>

<blockquote><p>I hope this message finds you well and I hope you&rsquo;re having a good day!</p>

<p>I wanted to reach out to you as I came across your information while researching candidates for a variety of engineering opportunities here at Google. Your experience could be interesting for a number of teams I work with.</p>

<p>Though I realize you might not be actively searching, I thought it would be beneficial for us to connect and possibly discuss Google in more detail.</p>

<p>Can we schedule a quick informal conversation in the next couple of weeks?</p></blockquote>

<p>How can these recruiters be so friendly when most of the e-mails you get are terrible and for jobs that are obviously not a match for you? It&rsquo;s because the incentives for these recruiters work differently, which causes their jobs to work differently.</p>

<p>The recruiting terminology for sending out these &lsquo;cold calls&rsquo; is &lsquo;Sourcing&rsquo; and from the people I&rsquo;ve talked to, its their least favorite thing about their jobs, but a necessary part of recruiting. Recruiters at agencies typically have quotas to meet, and almost universally their pay is dictated by how many people they hire. If you take a job through an agency, your new employer pays that agency some percentage (typically 10-20%) of your annual salary if you stick with the job for a few (typically 3-12) months.  This doesn&rsquo;t come out of your salary or make your salary any lower, it&rsquo;s simply a cost your employer pays to get new talent.</p>

<p>As for recruiters that don&rsquo;t work at agencies (like the ones I talked to this week), their salary isn&rsquo;t directly tied to head counts and hire salaries. Most of them don&rsquo;t even get bonuses for hiring tons of people and/or expensive/cheap people. They do have goals for positions they are trying to fill or number of hires in general, but they aren&rsquo;t incentivized to place you somewhere where you would be a poor fit.</p>

<p>These recruiters love their jobs and love making the perfect connection between a &lsquo;candidate&rsquo; (thats you!) and the right &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; (your sweet new gig). Some of them got their start with Liberal Arts degrees, while some did something technical.  Some have technical work backgrounds too, while others have experience like coordinating volunteer efforts at non-profits.  All of them love working with people, traveling, managing events, and connecting people to great jobs.</p>

<p>Companies like Google and Amazon have very high standards for hiring (and even have specific processes in place to continue to raise the bar for who they hire), and these standards apply to the recruiters they hire too. They can quickly understand who you are, what you do, and what might be a good job for you at their companies, and direct you directly to the people you&rsquo;d need to talk with to find out for sure: specific managers, directors, VPs, engineers, etc.</p>

<p>A recruiter from a big company should be able to pull off a good &ldquo;First Contact&rdquo; e-mail, and is someone you should consider talking to, even if you aren&rsquo;t looking for a new job.  I&rsquo;ve gotten to speak with people that I wouldn&rsquo;t have met any other way about company culture, how hiring works, how career development works, and plenty of other things, all of which will be useful to me in the future. Knowing what is going on at other companies, especially ones that have a lot of smart people putting a lot of thought into it, will help you at your current job or help you figure out what you want to do next.</p>
