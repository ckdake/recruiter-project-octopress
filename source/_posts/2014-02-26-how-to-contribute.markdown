Are you a a recruiter or a developer (or anyone else that interacts with a recruiter)?

You probably know some things that other people don't, and your contributions here will be a great help in making recruiting make more sense for everyone.

I've added a list of questions to the [about page](http://recruiterproject.org/about/). Send me your questions and your answers and they'll turn into blog posts.
