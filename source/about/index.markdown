Since around mid-2006 in graduate school at Georgia Tech, I've been contacted by literally hundreds and hundreds of recruiters. Some have led to interviews, some have led to new jobs, and some have been absolutely terrible. Since mid-2012 I have been a little more deliberate with recruiters, sending them to "<a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1630-how-to-recruit-developers-away-from-highgroove/">How to recruit developers away from Highgroove</a>" or having lunch with them to talk about what they are trying to do.  Hopefully I'll get a few of them to write content here.
